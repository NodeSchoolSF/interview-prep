## Intro

Self intro.

There's enough content to cover the whole duration of Nodeschool - if you need to head out to use bathroom or work on something else, that's totally fine. Also we'll have a food break.

Can interrupt with questions anytime.

## Interview prep

Startups.


## The interview process

Cover it.


## Data structures and algorithms

Go through how big-O applies to a real-life leetcode question. Implement both solutions and use online judge to show how O(n^2) exceeds time limit.

**After going through Valid Anagram, have students do a real problem: "contains duplicate", through collaborative pairing.**

**After this, alternate between illustrating a concept via a problem, and having people solve a related problem.**

**After the first collaborative pairing, ask if people would prefer trying a more "realistic" interviewer/interviewee scenario, or if they prefer to work together.**

Concepts and problems:

* Implement e.g. a "stack" class? (optional)
* Cover recursion/subproblems/DP, with coin change or climing stairs problems(?)
* Cover trees and graphs, from perspective of two leetcode questions? Implement DFS helper as part of a problem. **TODO**

## Technical phone screen practice

If people have specific questions they want to ask me about interviews in general, they can ask during this time.

Go over solutions. Go over what test cases I'd write.
