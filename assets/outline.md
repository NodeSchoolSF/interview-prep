## Intro

Self intro.

This will likely go until 5.

Can interrupt with questions anytime.

## Interview prep

Startups.


## The interview process

Cover it.


## Data structures and algorithms

Go through how big-O applies to a real-life leetcode question. Implement both solutions and use online judge to show how O(n^2) exceeds time limit.

**After going through Valid Anagram, have students do a real problem: "contains duplicate", through collaborative pairing.**

**After this, alternate between illustrating a concept via a problem, and having people solve a related problem. After the first collaborative pairing, can try to have them do a simulated interviewer/interviewee alternation.**

Concepts and problems:

* Implement e.g. a "stack" class? (optional)
* Cover recursion/subproblems/DP, with coin change or climing stairs problems(?)
* Cover trees and graphs, from perspective of two leetcode questions? Implement DFS helper as part of a problem. **TODO**

Point to additional resources.


## Technical phone screen practice

Arrange into pairs, and take turns (30 minutes each).

Have one person pick a problem for the other person. They'll read the question verbally first and the "interviewee" codes it up (not on leetcode).

If people don't want to do that, they can also pair on it instead of interview/interviewee. (can ask which format people would prefer)

Go over solutions (**TODO**: does this mean they should be fixed instead of from a pool? maybe not). Go over what test cases I'd write.
