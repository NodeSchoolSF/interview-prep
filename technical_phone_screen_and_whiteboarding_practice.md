# Technical phone screen and whiteboarding practice

## Prep advice

To see how a real phone screen can play out, you can watch a recording of someone solving [missing list item](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdCeU8DJvPM) well.

When I'm solving a Leetcode problem, I'll code it in a JS file and run `node problem.js` to evaluate it. I'll console.log or assert some test cases at the bottom to check the functionality. See some of the [solutions](/solutions) for examples of this.

Some useful posts on how to approach a fresh problem:

* [Google Interview Questions Deconstructed: Synonymous Queries](https://medium.com/@alexgolec/google-interview-problems-synonymous-queries-36425145387c) - a great post
* [Google Interview Problems: Ratio Finder](https://medium.com/@alexgolec/google-interview-problems-synonymous-queries-36425145387c) - a good breakdown of how to think about a graph search problem


## Paired practice

Pair up into groups of 2. Each person picks one of the questions to work on. One person go first and try to solve the problem on their computer (or on whiteboard, if they want to practice that) while the other person listens.

While you're listening to someone's solution, keep the following in mind:

* Did they ask clarifying questions before implementing?
* Do they explain their thought process as they're working?
* Is the solution efficient (in runtime)?
* Ask them the big-O for runtime and space.
* Do they come up with good test cases to try out?
* Try running it on Leetcode. Are there bugs? Does it run and pass the Leetcode test cases?
