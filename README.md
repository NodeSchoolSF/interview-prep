# NodeSchool Interview Prep Workshop

⚠️Workshop material is preliminary and will be subject to change.

This workshop is geared towards helping bootcamp grads and self-taught learners to prepare for the technical programming interview. It's based on what I know from interviewing at numerous startups and being an interviewer at three software startups. The goals of the workshop are to:

* Give **a roadmap on how to prepare** for the technical interview.
* Give an introduction to **important CS concepts**. There isn't nearly enough time to cover computer science fundamentals in depth, so this provides a quick overview and resources for further study.
* Give students a chance to **practice solving algorithms questions** with each other.

I'll talk for about an hour on topics like CS theory, testing, or behavioral questions. Then we'll use the rest of the time to practice solving algorithms questions together. This is an overview of the content that will be covered:

1. [**How to effectively interview prep**](interview_prep.md) [20 min] - recommended prep resources, strategies for solving difficult problems, thinking out loud, doing your research, behavioral questions, and side projects.
1. [**The interview process**](the_interview_process.md) [20 min] - the different stages of an interview process, including the technical phone screen, take-home challenges, and the onsite.
1. [**CS fundamentals**](cs_fundamentals.md) [60+ min]: Big O notation (runtime and space). Basic data structures like strings, arrays, stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. Recursion. Trees and tree traversal, graphs and graph search (depth-first, breadth-first).
1. [**Technical phone screen and whiteboarding practice**](technical_phone_screen_and_whiteboarding_practice.md) [90 min]: Folks will group into pairs and each solve a different problem, taking turns being interviewer and interviewee. I'll review the answers, showing how I would approach the problem.
