# NodeSchool Interview Prep

⚠️Course material is preliminary and will be subject to change.

This course is geared towards helping bootcamp grads and self-taught learners to prepare for the technical programming interview. It's based on what I know from interviewing at numerous startups and being an interviewer at three software startups. The goals of the course are to:

1. Give **a roadmap on how to prepare** for the technical interview.
2. Give an introduction to **important CS concepts**. There isn't nearly enough time to cover computer science fundamentals in depth, so this provides a quick overview and resources for further study.
3. Give students a chance to **practice solving algorithms questions** with each other.

In each class session, I'll talk for about an hour on topics like CS theory, testing, or behavioral questions. Then we'll use the rest of the time to practice solving algorithms questions together.


## Session 1 — Overview of the Interview Process, CS Fundamentals, & Technical Phone Screen Practice

* [**How to effectively interview prep**](interview_prep.md) [20 min] - recommended prep resources, strategies for solving difficult problems, thinking out loud, doing your research, behavioral questions, and side projects.
* [**The interview process**](the_interview_process.md) [20 min] - the different stages of an interview process, including the technical phone screen, take-home challenges, and the onsite.
* [**CS fundamentals**](cs_fundamentals.md) [60+ min]: Big O notation (runtime and space). Basic data structures like strings, arrays, stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. Recursion. Trees and tree traversal, graphs and graph search (depth-first, breadth-first).
* [**Technical phone screen and whiteboarding practice**](technical_phone_screen_and_whiteboarding_practice.md) [90 min]: Folks will group into pairs and each solve a different problem, taking turns being interviewer and interviewee. I'll review the answers, showing how I would approach the problem.
