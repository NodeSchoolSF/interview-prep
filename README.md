# NodeSchool Interview Prep Workshop

⚠️Workshop material is preliminary and will be subject to change.

This workshop is geared towards helping bootcamp grads and self-taught learners to prepare for the technical programming interview. It's based on what I know from interviewing at numerous startups and being an interviewer at three web startups. The goals of the workshop are to:

* Give **a roadmap on how to prepare** for the technical interview.
* Give an introduction to **important algorithmic concepts**. There isn't nearly enough time to cover computer science fundamentals in depth, so this provides a quick overview and resources for further study.
* Give students a chance to **practice solving algorithms questions** with each other.

This is an overview of the content that will be covered:

1. [**How to effectively interview prep**](interview_prep.md) [20 min] - recommended prep resources, strategies for solving difficult problems, thinking out loud, doing your research, behavioral questions, and side projects.
1. [**The interview process**](the_interview_process.md) [20 min] - the different stages of an interview process, including the technical phone screen, take-home challenges, and the onsite.
1. [**Data structures and algorithms**](data_structures_and_algorithms.md) [60+ min]: A rundown of CS concepts, using practical problems to demonstrate. Big O notation (runtime and space). Basic data structures like strings, arrays, stacks, queues, sets, and hash tables. Recursion. Trees and tree traversal, graphs and graph search (depth-first, breadth-first).
1. [**Technical phone screen and whiteboarding practice**](technical_phone_screen_and_whiteboarding_practice.md) [90 min]: Folks will group into pairs and each solve a different problem, taking turns being interviewer and interviewee. I'll review the answers, showing how I would approach the problem.
