## Intro

Self intro.

This will likely go until 5.

Programming interviews are notoriously challenging and can require a great depth of knowledge. We only have 2-3 hours, so this will be more of an outline or a map - in many cases I'll point you in (hopefully) the right direction, but I won't cover the topic in depth.

## Interview prep

Startups.

Cover basic behavioral Q's. Example answer for one?


## The interview process

Cover it.


## Data structures and algorithms

Go through how big-O applies to a real-life leetcode question. Implement both solutions and use online judge to show how O(n^2) exceeds time limit. Encourage people to re-implement themselves (in person there or later?).

Concepts and problems:

* Implement e.g. a "stack" class? (optional)
* Recognizing greedy, and DP (give examples)
* Cover recursion/subproblems/DP, with coin change or climing stairs problems(?)
* Cover trees and graphs, from perspective of two leetcode questions? Implement DFS helper as part of a problem. **TODO**

Point to additional resources.


## Technical phone screen practice

Arrange into pairs, and take turns (30 minutes each).

Have one person pick a problem for the other person. They'll read the question verbally first and the "interviewee" codes it up (not on leetcode).

If people don't want to do that, they can also pair on it instead of interview/interviewee. (can ask which format people would prefer)

Go over solutions (**TODO**: does this mean they should be fixed instead of from a pool? maybe not). Go over what test cases I'd write.
