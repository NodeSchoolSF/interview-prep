## Intro

Ask what part of the interview people need help with - getting their foot in the door (resume, recruiter call), phone screen, or onsite?

Ask what concepts people are familiar with:

* Recursion?

## Interview prep

Startups.

Cover basic behavioral Q's.


## The interview process

Cover it.


## CS fundamentals

Go through how big-O applies to a real-life leetcode question - how to reduce O(n^2) to O(n) for example. Implement both solutions and use online judge. Encourage people to re-implement themselves (in person there or later?).

Recognizing greedy, and DP (give examples).

Cover recursion/subproblems/DP, with coin change or climing stairs problems.

Cover trees and graphs, from perspective of two leetcode questions? Implement DFS as part of a problem. **TODO**

Mention which data structures are important, and leetcode problems that exercise each one.

Point to additional resources.


## Technical phone screen practice

Arrange into pairs, and take turns (30 minutes each).
