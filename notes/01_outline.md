## Intro

Programming interviews are notoriously challenging and can require a great depth of knowledge. We only have 2-3 hours, so this will be more of an outline or a map - in many cases I'll point you in (hopefully) the right direction, but I won't cover the topic in depth.

Ask what part of the interview people need help with - getting their foot in the door (resume, recruiter call), phone screen, or onsite?

Ask what concepts people are familiar with:

* Recursion?

## Interview prep

Startups.

Cover basic behavioral Q's. Example answer for one?


## The interview process

Cover it.


## CS fundamentals

Go through how big-O applies to a real-life leetcode question - how to reduce O(n^2) to O(n) for example. Implement both solutions and use online judge. Encourage people to re-implement themselves (in person there or later?).

Implement e.g. a "stack" class? (optional)

Recognizing greedy, and DP (give examples).

Cover recursion/subproblems/DP, with coin change or climing stairs problems.

Cover trees and graphs, from perspective of two leetcode questions? Implement DFS as part of a problem. **TODO**

Mention which data structures are important, and leetcode problems that exercise each one.

Point to additional resources.


## Technical phone screen practice

Arrange into pairs, and take turns (30 minutes each).

Have one person pick a problem for the other person. They'll read the question verbally first and the "interviewee" codes it up (not on leetcode).

Go over solutions (**TODO**: does this mean they should be fixed instead of from a pool? maybe not). Go over what test cases I'd write.
