# The interview process

Interview processes vary widely; [here are some interview formats](https://yangshun.github.io/tech-interview-handbook/interview-formats#formats-of-famous-companies) for specific companies. In my experience, these are common phases of the interview process for startups:

1. Initial phone call with recruiter or hiring manager
2. Technical phone screen
3. Take-home challenge (possibly)
4. On-site interview

## 1. The initial phone call

This is to evaluate whether continuing the process makes sense for both parties. They'll ask you about your background and experience. Enthusiasm for the company and mission and being well-spoken is often useful here.

See the earlier "Prep for behavioral questions" section for possible questions here.

## 2. The technical phone screen

This is usually a 1 hour phone call where an engineer or engineering manager asks you technical questions to evaluate whether to continue with the process.

You may be asked to explain technical concepts like "what is the event loop in javascript?".

Many companies will now do a remote coding challenge where they give you a question, and you code it up in a collaborative editor like [CoderPad](https://coderpad.io/) (which can run your code) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io) (for front-end stuff). You'll ideally be able to explain your thought process as you're coding.

Here are a few recordings of realistic technical phone screens which shows how the process works and how candidates think out loud:

* [Missing item list difference with an Airbnb engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdCeU8DJvPM) - very good candidate who communicates clearly
* [Coin change problem with a Google engineer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWW-jA6YjHk) - first 9 minutes are useful for seeing how candidate solves the naive version of the problem cleanly, and talks about big-O time complexity

Possible examples of questions you might see:

- `TODO`

## 3. The take-home challenge (possibly)

Some companies will issue a take-home challenge, which usually ranges from 1 to 4 hours, to be completed on your own time.

A few recommendations:

- Solve the base requirements of the challenge as quickly as possible without being bogged down by minor details. After that, you can feel comfortable to refactor your code.
- If you have time, write good tests. This is one way for you to stand out against other applicants, because tests aren't always prioritized highly by candidates.

## 4. The onsite interview

This is generally the most important factor in a hiring decision — the earlier phases usually serve to get you here. This can take around 5 hours and usually has you meeting with a variety of people on the team. Each person will ask you either technical questions or behavioral questions, and usually they'll all leave around 10 minutes for you to ask them questions as well.

General advice:

- **The interviewer is assessing cultural fit, or "would I enjoy working with this person?"** This seems vague, but it's actually pretty important when you'll be spending a lot of your waking hours together. Being a clear communicator and having a good attitude goes a long way here.
- **Demonstrate "coachability" — pick up hints quickly and take feedback graciously**. For junior candidates, interviewers also often look for "coachability". What this means is, if they weren't able to answer all the questions (which is mostly expected), can they be taught to pick things up quickly and easily? If you're stuck, an interviewer will often drop subtle or non-subtle hints about how to progress. If you can pick these hints up quickly and get un-stuck, it's a good sign that you can pick things up quickly on the job as well. What looks bad for coachability is if you get feedback or advice and question it or ignore it.
- **Ask clarifying questions if there's ambiguity.** Don't just jump into an implementation that you think is correct.
- **"Do you have any questions for me?"**  Interviewers will often leave time for you to ask them questions, and by the end of the day this will add up to a lot of time for your questions. These questions do matter — they can be used to assess what you're interested in (the tech stack? the mission?), and if you have an especially good question, an interviewer may take note of it. Be prepared to have at least some basic questions for each interviewer, and ideally have some tailored questions based on the product or company that demonstrate your interest in the mission.
- **You can admit you don't know something.** If you don't know something knowledge-based (i.e. a programming language construct or technology), interviewers will be able to tell. It can be better to own up to it and say you don't know something upfront instead of struggling with something that you can't deduce on the spot. This doesn't necessarily mean you should give up, though, if it's a question you can figure out.
